# Hi, I'm Eduardo Petenasi!

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
Hello! I'm Eduardo Paulino, a Computer Science student in my final semester at the Universidade Estadual do Norte do Paran√°. I have experience in web development and always look for opportunities to improve my skills.

Worked for a year as an intern using FlutterFlow, where I gained experience in Web development. During my time at university, I also took part in a community development project, contributing to real-world solutions and improving knowledge in **databases**, **web development**.

Current looking for my first job opportunity where I can apply my knowledge and continue to grow as a developer.
